Non Emergency Austin 311 Calls
Time Series Analysis

Introduction:

Non-emergency 311 call systems, used are increasingly in U.S. cities, and offer a number of advantages. They give citizens a quick, convenient way to kvetch about problems in their neighborhoods, and get a response. They enable city governments to identify patterns and address issues proactively. Thereâ€™s also an incidental boon: Massive amounts of accumulated data. A handful of social scientists have begun to see this data as a treasure trove. Specifically, they have started combing through it to see who is calling, and what this might tell us about the policies and culture of the cities in question.

About the data set:

The Austin 311 dataset that was used for the analysis was retrieved from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/austin-calls/downloads/austin-calls.zip/1 it includes 24 columns and roughly 436,000 rows with data ranging from 2013-2017. It includes variables like date, time, location, description, handling office, county and more, this dataset was compiled by the City of Austin

Objective:

We are looking at this dataset with the intent of trying to find any trends in the calls, particularity location or volumes of certain call types, and to see if we can predict future calls. 311 calls can provide insight into public complaints, and potentially provide interesting information to help optimize future resource allocation.
